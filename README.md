# ðŸŒ™ðŸ”’ File Encryptor

This project is a simple file encryptor and decryptor that runs entirely in the browser. Users can drag and drop files to encrypt or decrypt them using a password they provide. The application supports both light and dark modes, and it uses the Web Cryptography API for secure encryption and decryption.

## Features

- ðŸŒ‘ **Dark Mode by Default**: Toggle between dark and light modes with a simple switch.
- ðŸ–± **Drag and Drop**: Easily drag and drop files to encrypt or decrypt.
- ðŸ”‘ **Password Protection**: Enter a password to secure your files.
- ðŸ”’ **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption and decryption is done locally in the browser, ensuring your files never leave your device.
